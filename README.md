### Project description:
A game of pong with options to customize gameplay experience at the terminal or run at default parameters. Customizabile options include the ability to choose whether the game will launch in a single-player, two-players, or only-AI mode. If the single-player option is chosen, the user can further select which side of the game window they wish to play on, with the opposite paddle being controlled by the game AI. Customizable options available in common between single-player and two-player modes are player names, number of balls the game starts with, the speed of the balls, the speed of the paddles, and at what score the game should end. If the game starts in only-AI mode, all these options are still available apart from player name assignment. Starting the game with default parameters skips all prompts for customizability and initializes a game with one ball, set ball and paddle speeds, no AI, and a game ending score of 10. 
### Note:
This project was created to be submitted as the final project for the CS50P online Harvard course. I had no prior experiences in coding before this, and this project serves as the first programming project that I have undertaken on my own.
