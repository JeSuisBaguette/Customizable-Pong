AI breakdown:
        A list of balls headed towards the respective paddle is created.
        Using this list, the distance from the center of the balls to the center of the paddle is calculated. 
        The ball with the closest distance to the paddle is returned for comparison.
        Comparison between the paddle center and the ball center is evaluated for y-coordinates. A boolean is returned.
        Depending on the boolean, the paddle is moved up or down to align it's center to the ball's center.
