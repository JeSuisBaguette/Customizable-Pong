AI breakdown:
    Single ball is always followed by paddle movement
    In the case of multiple balls, checks ball direction
    Only moves if ball direction is towards paddle
    Compares x coordinate of ball center when multiple balls share correct directionality and moves to intercept closest ball along X-axis
    If the above is true, compares Y coordinate of the ball centers to the paddle center and moves to intercept closest ball along Y-axis
